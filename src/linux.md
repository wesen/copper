## Shortcut: Just use this docker image

It's based on Ubuntu 16.04 and comes with all the required dependencies:

```
$ docker run --privileged -it japaric/copper:2016-05-10
# Or use a newer tag. See https://hub.docker.com/r/japaric/copper/tags
```

Alternatively, instead of using this docker image, you can ...

## Install the tools on your system

On most Linux distributions, most of the required tools can be installed via the
package manager. The actual command that you need to call will depend on your
Linux distribution. But, here's the one for Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi openocd qemu-system-arm
```

To install Rust and Cargo, I recommend using [rustup]:

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs/

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain=nightly
```

Or if you already have rustup installed, switch to the nightly channel with:

```
$ rustup default nightly
```

To install Xargo simply use:

```
$ cargo install xargo
```

Note that Xargo 0.2.0+ depends on the `rust-src` component, so install that as
well:

```
$ rustup component add rust-src
```

## First OpenOCD connection

> **TODO** document STM32VLDISCOVERY quirk

Even if using the Docker image, it's a good idea to test that OpenOCD works by
establishing a connection between your host system (PC, laptop, etc.) and your
dev board. First, you'll have to physically connect your dev board and your host
system via an USB cable. Then, you'll have to use a command that looks like
this:

```
$ sudo openocd -f board/$BOARD
```

if you are using a dev board that has a built-in debugger. Or one like this:

```
$ sudo openocd -f interface/$INTERFACE -f target/$TARGET
```

if you are using an external programmer/debugger. Then, you should get an output
like this:

```

The program will block with that output, but it's okay to exit it with `Ctrl-C`
at this time.

As for the actual values of `$BOARD`/`$INTERFACE`/`$TARGET` that you must use,
the possible values are in `/usr/share/openocd/scripts` (might be a different
directory in your Linux distribution):

```
$ tree /usr/share/openocd/scripts
/usr/share/openocd/scripts
├── (...)
├── board
│   ├── actux3.cfg
│   ├── adapteva_parallella1.cfg
│   └── (...)
├── interface
│   ├── altera-usb-blaster2.cfg
│   ├── altera-usb-blaster.cfg
│   └── (...)
├── target
│   ├── aduc702x.cfg
│   ├── aducm360.cfg
│   └── (...)
└── (...)
```

Try something that resembles the name of your hardware. For example, for the
STM32VLDISCOVERY I use:

```
$ sudo openocd -f board/stm32vldiscovery.cfg
```

And for the STM32F3DISCOVERY, I use:

```
$ sudo openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

### (Optional) OpenOCD without `sudo`

The reason we have to use `sudo` in the `openocd` invocations is that we don't
have sufficient permissions to use the USB device. This can be fixed using
`udev` rules.

First let's identify the USB device OpenOCD is using from the output of `sudo
openocd`:

```
$ sudo openocd
```

```
$ lsusb
(...)
Bus 003 Device 116: ID 0483:3744 STMicroelectronics STLINK Pseudo disk
(...)
```

Device number 116 on the bus 3, let's check its permissions:

```
$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/003/116
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 371 May  9 15:39 /dev/bus/usb/003/116
```

Only `root` can read/write from/to it. We'll write an udev rule to change the
permissions of this particular USB device. udev rules are stored in
`/etc/udev/rules.d` as files, let's add a new one:

```
$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-openocd.rules
# STLINKv1
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3744", GROUP="users"
```

This udev rule changes the group of the USB device to `users`.

> **NOTE** You *can* use a group different than `users`. **But**, if you are
> using a Docker container, it's very likely that the id of a different group
> won't match between the host system and the container -- in that case you
> still won't have enough permissions to use the USB device!.

> **NOTE** For more details about the udev rules see [man 7 udev]

[man 7 udev]: http://linux.die.net/man/7/udev

You'll have to change 0483 and 3744 for the vendor and product id of **your**
device respectively. You can get those values from `lsusb`:

```
$ lsusb | grep STLINK
Bus 003 Device 116: ID 0483:3744 STMicroelectronics STLINK Pseudo disk
                       ^^^^ ^^^^
```

This new rule won't come into effect until you reload all the rules with:

```
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Now, unplug and re-plug the device and you should see the updated permissions:

```
$ lsusb | grep STLINK
Bus 003 Device 118: ID 0483:3744 STMicroelectronics STLINK Pseudo disk

$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/003/118
crw-rw-r-- 1 root users 189, 373 May  9 16:00 /dev/bus/usb/003/118
```

You should now be able to use your `openocd` command without `sudo` **if** your
user was already part of the `users` group. If your user wasn't in that group,
you can add yourself to this group with this command:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G users $(whoami)
```

You'll have to re-log for this last command to take effect.
