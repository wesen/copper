# Windows

There's no default package manager in Windows so you'll have to scavenge the
tools from different locations:

## Cross toolchain and Co.

The C cross compiler, the binary inspection tools and the debugger can all be
installed from a [single place]. Simply grab the latest `.exe` installer, run it
and follow the instructions. Before finishing the installation process, make
sure to check the "Add path to environment variable" option.

[single place]: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download

Check that the tools are really in your `PATH`

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -v
(..)
gcc version 5.4.1 20160609 (..)

$ arm-none-eabi-size -v
GNU size <GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors> 2.26.0.20160616
(..)

$ arm-none-eabi-gdb -v
GNU gdb <GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors> 7.10.1.20160616-cvs
(..)
```

## OpenOCD

There are no official binary releases of OpenOCD for Windows, but [this page]
has unofficial releases. There is not installer so grab the latest zipfile and
unpack somewhere in your main drive. Then update your `PATH` variable by
appending `;Z:\directory\where\you\extracted\the\zipfile\bin` to it. This should
make the `openocd` command available anywhere:

[this page]: http://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/

```
$ echo %path%
(..);C:\OpenOCD-0.9.0-Win32\bin

$ openocd -v
Open On-Chip Debugger 0.9.0 <2015-08-15-12:41>
(..)
```

After installing OpenOCD, be sure to test it using [these instructions]. The
instructions are for Linux but they pretty much hold for Windows: just ignore
the `sudo` part of the commands used there.

[these instructions]: linux.html#First%20OpenOCD%20connection

There are some caveats with using OpenOCD on Windows:

- OpenOCD script search path will be empty. Commands like `openocd -f
  board/stm32vldiscovery.cfg` will fail to find the `.cfg` file. This can be
  remedied by passing an extra argument to the command: `openocd -s
  Z:\path\to\openocd\share\openocd\scripts -f board/stm32vldiscovery.cfg`.

> **TODO** There must be a better solution to the script search path problem

- Some (hardware) programmers/debuggers (like the ST-LINK/V1) will try to use
  the "wrong" driver by default and the `openocd` command will always fail with
  `LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`. You'll have to switch their driver to the WinUSB
  driver using Zadig (see the following section for more information).

## (Optional) Zadig

If you are getting the `LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error when trying to connect
to your programmer/debugger using OpenOCD, use Zadig to override the USB driver
that Windows picked:

- First, install Zadig from [its website].

- Make sure your device is connected to the host machine!

- Then launch Zadig and choose the menu item: Options > List all devices.

- The drop-down list should now be populated; from it, pick your device (e.g.
  STM32 STlink).

- Pick WinUSB as the target driver, click the "Replace Driver" button and follow
  the instructions that pop up.

[its website]: http://zadig.akeo.ie/

Try the `openocd` command again; it should succeed this time.

## QEMU

You can find unofficial binaries [here]. Install a recent version and add
`;Z:\Program Files\qemu` to your `PATH`.

[here]: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/

Test it with:

```
$ qemu-system-arm -version
```

The command won't print to the console but instead redirect its output to the
file `Z:\Program Files\qemu\stdout`. It should contain something like this:

```
$ type Z:\Program Files\qemu\stdout.txt
```

## Rust and Cargo

Head to the [rustup] website and follow the instructions.

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs/

## Xargo

Simply call this command:

```
$ cargo install xargo
```

Note that Xargo 0.2.0+ depends on the `rust-src` component, so install that as
well:

```
$ rustup component add rust-src
```
