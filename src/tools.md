# Setting up a development environment

Working with embedded systems requires extra tooling as cross compilation is at the heart of the
development process. This chapter will introduce the tools we'll use, why we need them and how to
install them on the 3 major OSes.

Without further ado, these are the tools we'll use:

- [Rust & Cargo: nightly edition][rust]
- [A cross C linker: arm-none-eabi-gcc][gcc]
- [Binary inspection tools][binutils]
  - [arm-none-eabi-objdump][objdump]
  - [arm-none-eabi-size][size]
- [A debugger][*db]
- [An emulator: QEMU][qemu]
- [Xargo][xargo]
- [OpenOCD][openocd]

The rest of this page will justify each of these tools. For installation instructions check the
subsections of this chapter: [Linux], [Mac] and [Windows]

## Rust & Cargo: nightly edition
[rust]: tools.html#Rust%20%26%20Cargo%3A%20nightly%20edition

Rust & Cargo don't need  much explanation. To build Rust programs we'll need the Rust compiler,
`rustc`, and the Rust package manager, Cargo.

What does need justification is the use of the nightly channel. We need to use the nightly channel
because we'll make use of the following unstable features:

- `asm`: We'll use some inline assembly via the `asm!` syntax extension. But that syntax extension
  hasn't been stabilized.
- `lang_items`: The need for this feature gate is sometimes artificial. The compiler demands some
  lang times, like `eh_personality` and `panic_fmt`, to be defined even if the functionality they
  provide (unwinding/panicking) is never used in our program.
- To cross compile programs we need a cross compiled `core` crate. The Rust project doesn't
  distribute a binary release of that crate for Cortex-M microcontrollers so we have to cross
  compile that crate ourselves. As the `core` crate relies on lots of unstable features, we have to
  use the nightly channel to cross compile it.

## A cross C linker: `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
[gcc]: tools.html#A%20cross%20C%20linker%3A%20arm-none-eabi-gcc

(`arm-none-eabi-gcc` is not a linker per se but `rustc` uses it as a proxy for `arm-none-eabi-ld`.)

> Wait, aren't we going to write Rust? Why do we need a *C compiler*?

`rustc` uses `gcc` to link intermediate object files so we pretty much have no choice.

## Binary inspection tools
[binutils]: tools.html#Binary%20inspection%20tools

When working this close to the hardware and with devices that have constrained resources and
mandatory memory layouts, it's pretty important to inspect the produced binaries to keep track of
their sizes and to check that the produced binaries follow a specific memory layout.

We'll mainly use the following two tools:

### `arm-none-eabi-size`
[size]: tools.html#arm-none-eabi-size

To keep an eye on the binary size of our applications.

### `arm-none-eabi-objdump`
[objdump]: tools.html#arm-none-eabi-objdump

To confirm the memory layout of our program matches the memory layout constraints of the target
device.

## A debugger
[*db]: tools.html#A%20debugger

A debugger is vital when working with microcontrollers as other debugging methods like logging or
*cough* `println` may not be available. This is specially true when you are just starting out and
haven't yet written drivers for peripherals that allow microcontroller <-> PC communication.

We'll mainly use `arm-none-eabi-gdb` in this document as `lldb` doesn't provide all the
functionality we need.

## An emulator: QEMU
[qemu]: tools.html#An%20emulator%3A%20QEMU

Before trying out our first program on real hardware, we'll run it under an emulator to verify that
the program works as expected.

## Xargo
[xargo]: tools.html#Xargo

In general, cross compiling requires cross compiled "standard" crates like the `core` or the `std`
crate. Binary releases of these crates for Cortex-M microcontrollers are not provided by the
Rust project so we'll have to cross compile these ourselves. Just cross compiling is not enough
though, as one must place the produced binaries in a specific directory layout called a "sysroot".
Because this process is cumbersome and error prone, I have [created Xargo]. Xargo is a *transparent*
Cargo wrapper that automatically builds and manages sysroots without user intervention.

[created Xargo]: https://github.com/japaric/xargo

Usage looks like this:

```
$ cargo build --target cortex-m3 && echo OK
```
```
   Compiling app v0.1.0
error: can't find crate for `core` [E0463]

error: aborting due to previous error
error: Could not compile `app`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```
```
$ xargo build --target cortex-m3 && echo OK
```
```

## OpenOCD
[openocd]: tools.html#OpenOCD

[OpenOCD] is a tool that lets your computer communicate with devices that support the JTAG/SWD
communication protocol. We'll use OpenOCD to *flash* (write) our programs into the microcontroller
and to debug them (with the help of `gdb`).
