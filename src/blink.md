# Blinking an LED

(with too many hexadecimals)

> **HEADS UP** Most of the links in this page are PDFs!

So far we have only used the processor inside our microcontroller. The processor
can only do math and logic, and, on its own, it can't interact with the external
world: it can't drive a LED or a motor, read a sensor or communicate with other
devices.

To make our programs more useful (and fun!) we must learn to use *peripherals*.
A peripheral is an extra piece of electronics that's built, alongside the
processor, in the same microcontroller package. Peripherals give the processor
the extra functionality it needs to interact with the external world.

> Awesome! What can I do with these peripherals?

All sort of things! There are several different types of peripherals, each one
provides a different functionality. Microcontrollers manufacturers call them by
different names even if they provide the same functionality though. Here are
some of the most common ones (using STM32 naming convention):

- `GPIO`. General Purpose Input/Output. Can be used to turn on/off external
  devices (e.g. a motor, a lamp, etc.) or to read the state of a "switch"
  (e.g. a two-state (ON/OFF) switch, a keyboard, etc.).

- `ADC`. Analog-to-Digital Converter. Can be used to "read" analog sensors (e.g.
  a thermometer, a light (intensity) sensor, etc.) or signals (e.g. voltage
  level of a battery, electric current, etc.).

- `TIM`. Timers. Can be used to perform periodic tasks (e.g. every 100 ms),
  measure lengths of time (e.g. for how long was this button pressed?) or
  generate periodic signals with variable [duty cycle][dc]
  (AKA [Pulse Width Modulation][pwm] (PWM)). PWM is mainly used to control how
  much power is supplied to an electric machine like a motor which, in turn,
  lets you indirectly control other parameters like speed and torque.

We'll explore these and several other peripherals in more detail in a [later
chapter].

> So, how do I use these peripherals?

Thanks to some magic called [memory mapped I/O][MMIO], to the processor,
peripherals appear as memory regions (!). This means that, for example, by
writing to some special memory address you can use the digital I/O peripheral to
turn on/off a LED. Another example: By reading from some special memory address
you can use the Analog to Digital Converter peripheral to "read" an analog
sensor like a thermometer and get the current environment temperature as a
digital/discrete value.

[MMIO]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O

A chunk of memory associated to a single peripheral is known as a "register
block".  As other types of memory, these regions are usually accessed in word
sized chunks (32-bit on ARM). Each of these word sized chunks is referred to as
a (hardware) register; though registers can also be half-word or byte sized.
Each of these registers has a human-friendly name and an address associated to
it.

A concrete example: The STM32F303VCT6 microcontroller has a peripheral known as
Reset and Clock Control (RCC). The register block associated with this
peripheral starts at address `0x4002_10000`. This register block is comprised of
several registers as seen on its [register map]. One of registers associated
with this peripheral is the ["AHB peripheral clock enable register"][AHBENR]
(AKA `APB2ENR`) which lives at address `0x4002_1014`. This particular register
can be used to power on/off other peripherals.

To get familiar with the use of peripherals, we'll write the microcontroller
version of the "hello world" program: Blinking an LED.

## The device-agnostic plan

This is an overview of what our program will do:

1. Power on the digital output peripheral.

To save energy, most of the peripherals in a microcontroller boot in a powered
off state. We have to explicitly "power on" the peripherals we want to use.

2. Put the *pin* that's connected to the LED in *output mode*.

A pin a metal contact that a microcontroller exposes and that can be
electrically connected to another device. A pin can either be (configured) to be
in input mode or in output mode, but it must be in output mode to be able to
drive (i.e. supply current to) an external device. Most pins start in input mode
right after the micro boots to avoid spuriously driving external devices.

3. Set the pin *high* or *low* to turn on the LED.

*Low* means outputting zero volts (0V) on the pin whereas *high* means
outputting a non-zero voltage, usually the power supply voltage (3.3V on most
Cortex-M micros), on the pin. Depending on how the LED is wired to the pin,
setting the pin low/high should turn it off/on or the other way around.

After we've confirmed that we can turn the LED on/off, we'll modify the program
to toggle the state of the LED pin every few seconds.

## The device-specific details

Now we must fill in the device-specific details to realize our plan. All the
needed information will come from the microcontroller reference manual
([here's mine][rm]) and the dev board user manual ([here's mine][um]).

### Which LED, which pin?

First, we must pick a LED on the dev board to work with. Your dev board very
likely has at least one "user LED" that's connected to one of the
microcontroller's pin (check its user manual). Don't confuse an "user LED" with
the "power LED". The latter is an indicator of whether the board is powered on
or off and can't be controlled by the microcontroller.

> **TODO** What do I do if my dev board doesn't have an "user LED"?

The STM32F3DISCOVERY has [eight user LEDs][leds]. For this example, I'll be
using the red one that's connected to the pin *PE9*. Because micros have many
I/O pins, these pins are usually grouped in *ports*. A port is a collection of
8, 16, or some other number of pins. Ports are usually identified with letters:
A, B, etc. and the pins in it are usually identified with numbers: 0, 1, etc.
Therefore, you can think of the the pin PE9 as the 10th (because numbering
starts at 0) pin in the port E.

### How to power on a peripheral?

Micros have a dedicated peripheral that's in charge of "clocking" other
peripherals. Clocking in this context means powering on/off a peripheral. A
peripheral that doesn't receive a clock signal is basically powered off -- it
can't be used and it doesn't (actively) consume energy.

On STM32 micros this peripheral is called [RCC]. The family of `*ENR` registers
in this peripheral control the clocking of other peripherals. In my case, I'm
interested in the [AHBENR] register which contains a `IOPEEN` bit that controls
the clocking of the E port.

[RCC]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/a2/2d/02/4b/78/57/41/a3/CD00246267.pdf/files/CD00246267.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00246267.pdf#page=69&zoom=auto,67,755

### How to put the pin in output mode?

In my case, I need to put the pin `PE9` in output mode. Some register in the
[GPIOE] peripheral should let me do that. After looking through the
documentation, I found that the `MODER` register does that. In particular, the
[MODER] register contains the bitfield `MODER9` which control the "mode" (input
or output) of the pin `PE9`. I'll use the following setting:

[GPIOE]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/4a/19/6e/18/9d/92/43/32/DM00043574.pdf/files/DM00043574.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00043574.pdf#page=228&zoom=auto,67,755
[MODER]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/4a/19/6e/18/9d/92/43/32/DM00043574.pdf/files/DM00043574.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00043574.pdf#page=237&zoom=auto,67,669

- `MODER9 = 0b01` Puts the pin in general purpose push-pull output mode.

### Driving the pin high and low

Again the register that I want must be in the `GPIOE` peripheral. In this case,
it's the `BSRR` register. It can individually *set* or *reset* a pin. Here,
*reset* means putting the pin low and *set* means driving the pin high.

## Putting it all together

Here's a detailed specification of the program:

1. Turn on the GPIOC peripheral: Set the `IOPEEN` bit in the `RCC->AHBENR`
   register to `1`.

2. Put the PE9 pin in output mode: Set the `MODER9` bitfield in the
   `GPIOE->MODER` register to `0b01`.

3. Set the PE9 pin high: Set the `BS9` bit in the `GPIOE->BSRR` register to `1`.

4. Set the PE9 pin low: Set the `BR9` bit in the `GPIOE->BSRR` register to `1`.

## The code

And here's the code. I'm omitting the `exception` and `lang_items` modules which
haven't changed since [our previous program].

[our previous program]: ./exceptions.html#Installing%20the%20exception%20handlers

``` rust
#[export_name = "_reset"]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    power_on_gpioe();
    put_pe9_in_output_mode();
    set_pe9_high();
    set_pe9_low();

    loop {}
}

fn power_on_gpioe() {
    /// Start address of the RCC register block
    const RCC: u32 = 0x4002_1000;

    /// Offset address of the AHBENR register
    const RCC_AHBENR: u32 = 0x14;

    /// IOPCEN bit mask
    const RCC_AHBENR_IOPEEN: u32 = 1 << 21;

    unsafe {
        // Pointer to the AHBENR register
        let ahbenr = (RCC + RCC_AHBENR) as *mut u32;

        // IOPECN = 1
        *ahbenr |= RCC_AHBENR_IOPEEN;
    }
}

/// Start address of the GPIOC register block
const GPIOE: u32 = 0x4800_1000;

/// Offset address of the BSRR register
const GPIOE_BSRR: u32 = 0x18;

fn put_pe9_in_output_mode() {
    /// Offset address of the CRH register
    const GPIOE_MODER: u32 = 0x0;

    unsafe {
        // Pointer to the MODER register
        let moder = (GPIOE + GPIOE_MODER) as *mut u32;

        // MODER9 = 0b01
        *moder = (*moder & !(0b11 << 18)) | (0b01 << 18)
    }
}

fn set_pe9_high() {
    unsafe {
        // Pointer to the BSRR register
        let bsrr = (GPIOE + GPIOE_BSRR) as *mut u32;

        // BS9 = 1
        *bsrr = 1 << 9;
    }
}

fn set_pe9_low() {
    unsafe {
        // Pointer to the BSRR register
        let bsrr = (GPIOE + GPIOE_BSRR) as *mut u32;

        // BR9 = 1
        *bsrr = 1 << (16 + 9);
    }
}
```

Quite unsightly, right? So many magic values. In a [later chapter], we'll
refactor this code to get rid of the magic values, the pointer arithmetic and
the raw pointers. But this code will make do for now!

[later chapter]: ./registers.html

## Test it

Time to test our code! Don't feel discouraged if your program crashes or doesn't
work on the first try! I certainly get most of my embedded programs wrong when
I'm just starting to write drivers and have to deal with all these magic values
and/or have to jump back and forth between the microcontroller reference manual
and my library/program.

OK, here's how I'd debug this program:

1. Starting from the program entry point, `_step`, repeatedly `step` over the
   program until you hit the the "set the pin high" statement, in my case this
   is the `*bsrr = 1 << 8`. If you didn't hit an exception, congratulations!
   Head to step 3, otherwise go to step 2.

2. If you hit an exception, you should now know which statement triggered it.
   Reset your microcontroller with `monitor reset halt`, then step all the way
   until your reach the faulty statement but don't execute it!. At this point,
   inspect the address of the register that will be modified by the faulty
   statement. Is the address right/valid? If not, fix it then go to step 1.

3. You should now be about to execute the instruction that sets the LED pin
   high. Step from here all the way to the endless `loop`. This should toggle
   the state of the LED at least once. If it doesn't, then quite a few things
   could have gone wrong ... See below:

- Wrong register address as seen in step 2.

- `GPIO` has not been powered on or configured properly. You'll have to
  "examine" (`(gdb) x $ADDRESS`) all the related registers. If you didn't power
  on the `GPIO` peripheral, you'll see that trying to write to that peripheral
  registers has no effect.

- You are driving the wrong pin, i.e. one that's not connected to an LED.
  Confirm this against your dev board user manual.

## Adding a loop

Now that we know that we can toggle the state of the LED. Making the LED blink
is relatively easy. We need to add a `delay` function and then move the LED
toggling code inside a loop:

``` rust
#[export_name = "_reset"]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    power_on_gpioe();
    put_pe9_in_output_mode();

    let ticks = 100_000;
    loop {
        set_pe9_high();
        delay(ticks);
        set_pe9_low();
        delay(ticks);
    }
}

fn delay(n: u32) {
    for _ in 0..n {}
}
```

I have no way of telling you what value of `n` will give you e.g. a delay of 1
second because that depends on the built-in internal clock of your
microcontroller (mine is 8 MHz) and the actual instructions that `delay`
compiles to in debug mode. However, using a value between `10_000` and `100_000`
for `ticks` should make the LED blink at a visible rate.

## Test it again

To test, simply flash the program and let it run from the debugger:

```
(gdb) continue
```

You should now see the LED blink at some rate. To make the LED blink faster make
the value of `ticks` smaller. To do this, first manually break the program by
pressing `Crtl-C` at `gdb`'s prompt, then use the following commands:

```
# break somewhere inside the loop
(gdb) break main.rs:13

(gdb) continue
Breakpoint 1, app::main () at (..)/src/main.rs:13
13              set_pe9_high()

# make ticks smaller
(gdb) set ticks = 10000

# clear breakpoint
(gdb) clear main.rs:13

(gdb) continue
```

The LED should now blink at a faster rate. You can repeat the experiment but
setting `ticks` to a larger value.
