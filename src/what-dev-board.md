# What is a dev board?

Dev board is the short term for "development board". When dealing with embedded
systems it is typical to have an application specific PCB board which carries
the processor you are going to write software for. However, sometimes you don't
know what your hardware looks like at the start of a project, or maybe you want
to be able to rapidly prototype by connecting different sensors and actuators to
your processor without having to make a new PCB board every time. This is where
dev boards come in, they are essentially the bare minimum you need (sometimes
with some additional sensors for evaluation) to turn on the processor, program
it, and connect things to it. If you are familiar with the [Arduino] platform,
that is a dev board.

While you can use an emulator to follow along it is more fun, and more
rewarding, to make command real hardware to do your bidding. So lets choose one!

# What dev board should I use/get?

I won't force you to use a specific dev board. This document has been written in
a device-agnostic way so you can follow it with pretty much any dev board you
want. Where a specific dev board is targeted it will be stated explicitly.

Nonetheless, some dev boards are easier to work with than others. This section
will provide you some advice on how to pick a dev board that will make your life
easier.

When we are choosing a dev board we are looking at the following parameters,
which are outlined in more detail below:

- Supports OpenOCD. Which is what we will use to load and debug compiled
  binaries of our Rust code.

- Has good documentation. You always will have the datasheet from the
  manufacturer, but good and easy to follow documentation on the boards pinout,
  how it relates to the processor and what other goodies you have is key.

- Community! Some dev boards have more of a following than others, while others
  will be using C/C++ the community can help with hardware related issues, or
  maybe even by providing example C code which can be helpful for getting
  started.

## OpenOCD support

We'll use OpenOCD to "flash" and debug the programs we'll develop. It's best if
you can get a dev board with a built-in debugger that's supported by OpenOCD.
You can see a list of such boards [here].

One example of such dev board is the [STM32F3DISCOVERY] which I'm going to
use throughout the examples of this document. It seems that most of
the [other evaluation boards][discoveries] by STM32 also have a built-in
debugger and are supported by OpenOCD. I'm not familiar with other vendors like
Atmel and NXP but they probably have similar offerings.

[discoveries]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-mcu-discovery-kits.html

Alternatively, you can use a board that doesn't have a built-in debugger if the
microcontroller in it is supported by OpenOCD (check [this list][target]) and
the board exposes a JTAG/SWD connector, but you'll also need an external
debugger supported by OpenOCD (check [this list][interface]). This is more
complicated as you'll have to read about the JTAG/SWD interface to make an
informed decision and you'll also have to figure out how to wire up everything
together.

## Good documentation

The microcontroller in it should have documentation about:

- The peripherals it provides: How they work and the registers associated with
  them. This document is known as the *Reference Manual* ([example][rm]),
  although sometimes this information is contained in the *Data Sheet*
  ([example][ds]).

- Hardware bugs (yes, hardware can have bugs too!) or device limitations that
  may be present in the revision of the hardware that you own and how to work
  around them. This document is known as *Silicon Errata* or just *Errata Sheet*
  ([example][se]).

# Dev boards that Rustaceans have used before

Or that we are sure work just fine.

- [STM32F3DISCOVERY]
  - Recommended if you are a beginner as we have beginner friendly documentation
    tailored for this specific board. Check the [Discovery] book.

  - There's a crate, [f3], that targets this board and provides a high
    level, easy to use API.

  - Has an on-board programmer/debugger

  - Has OpenOCD and GDB support

[f3]: https://crates.io/f3

[Discovery]: https://japaric.github.io/discovery

- [Other DISCOVERY boards][discoveries]
  - Have an on-board programmer/debugger

  - Have OpenOCD and GDB support

- [Nucleo boards](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo.html)
  - Pretty much like the DISCOVERYs but in an Arduino-compatible form factor

  - You can use Arduino shields with these boards

  - Have an on-board programmer/debbuger

  - Have OpenOCD and GDB support

- [Teensy 3.x](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)
  - High level crate, like f3, that targets this board: [teensy3]

  - Can flash programs with just a USB cable (has a USB bootloader)

  - No debug support (GDB) AFAIK because the SWD pins are not exposed

[teensy3]: https://crates.io/crates/teensy3

- [Tiva-C Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl)
  - Has an on-board programmer/debugger

  - Has OpenOCD and GDB support

- [Stellaris Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-lm4f120xl)
  - Has an on-board programmer/debugger

  - Has OpenOCD and GDB support

- Arduino [Due] & [Zero]
  - Can flash programs with just a USB cable (has a USB bootloader)

  - Debugging requires an external debugger (more hardware)
