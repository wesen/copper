The goal of this book is to get you started in *microcontroller software
development*. We'll mainly cover *bare metal programming* (programming directly
*on* hardware, without OS abstractions/services) but I hope we'll tread into OS
development territory (e.g. schedulers) in the latter chapters. We'll use the
[Rust programming language] and ARM [Cortex-M] microcontrollers as a means to
that end.

(Hopefully) At the end of this book the reader will:

- Be able to program any (ARM Cortex-M) microcontroller that's supported by the
  Rust compiler and is minimally/properly documented.

- Become familiar with the *peripherals* (functionality) commonly provided by
  microcontrollers: analog/digital I/O, communication protocols, timers, etc.

- Be able to write drivers for these peripherals and be able to compose them
  into applications.

- Know how to use existing (C) tooling to inspect, profile and debug the program
  they wrote.
