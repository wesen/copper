# Exceptions: Crashing your micro

In the previous chapter we wrote a very simple program, built a binary from it,
verified that said binary was well-formed (i.e. that it had a vector table where
expected), and even executed it under an emulator and also on real hardware.
Everything went smoothly! However, when developing things are bound to go awry
at some point. In the worst case scenario, one might, by mistake, ask the
microcontroller to perform an operation that it can't handle, like:

- Reading/writing to a invalid memory address e.g. beyond the limits of the RAM
  region.

- Writing to flash memory using simple assignments (`*ptr = value`). Flash
  memory has an elaborate write mechanism.

- Executing an instruction that the microcontroller doesn't support. Like trying
  to execute a floating point instruction (e.g. `vadd.f32`) on a device without
  a FPU.

Under these situations, the processor will raise a *hardware exception*. When an
exception is raised, the normal flow of our program is *interrupted* (stopped)
and the processor jumps to an exception *handler* (recall: handler is just
another name for function).

There are several types of exceptions but most of them signify a catastrophic
failure and, in real applications, are usually handled by resetting the system
(if bare metal) or by resetting/killing the faulty process (if running on top of
an OS). These catastrophic exceptions should happen rarely though (if ever)
during the execution of a program; hence the name "exception".

As we are just starting out and we are going to be running our programs under
the debugger, we'll handle all the exceptions the same way: we'll halt the
processor and yield control back to the debugger using the `bkpt` instruction.

> **NOTE** Executing the `bkpt` instruction when there is no debugger attached
> to the processor will make the processor raise an exception!

## Installing the exception handlers

As the official ARM [documentation] states, the exception vectors (recall: a
vector is a pointer to a handler, i.e. a function pointer) must be stored in the
vector table just right after the reset vector. We'll extend our linker script,
`layout.ld`, to account for this:

[documentation]: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABIFJFG.html

``` diff
     /* Vector table */
     LONG(ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM))
     LONG(_reset + 1);
+    KEEP(*(.rodata._EXCEPTIONS));

     /* Reset handler */
     _reset = .;
```

The change is quite literal: "Place the exceptions (the `_EXCEPTIONS` symbol)
right after the address of the reset handler (`LONG(_reset + 1)`)".

Note that this time we use `.rodata._EXCEPTIONS` rather than
`.text._EXCEPTIONS`. The reason is that the `_EXCEPTIONS` symbol is "data" and
not a function.

Now, we need create this `_EXCEPTIONS` symbol in our program:

``` rust
// Add this to `src/main.rs`

#![feature(asm)]

mod exception {
    pub extern "C" fn handler() {
        unsafe {
            asm!("bkpt");
        }

        loop {}
    }

    #[export_name = "_EXCEPTIONS"]
    pub static EXCEPTIONS: [Option<extern "C" fn()>; 14] = [Some(handler), // NMI
                                                            Some(handler), // Hard fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Memmanage fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Bus fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Usage fault
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            Some(handler), // SVCall
                                                            None, // Reserved for Debug
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            Some(handler), // PendSV
                                                            Some(handler)]; // Systick
}
```

Let's go over each section added to our program:

``` rust
mod exception {
    pub extern "C" fn handler() {
        unsafe {
            asm!("bkpt");
        }

        loop {}
    }

    ..
}
```

`exception::handler` is the handler (function) that we'll use to handle all the
exceptions. This handler uses the `bkpt` instruction to trigger a manual
breakpoint and then loops endlessly. We avoid returning from this function
because whatever triggered the exception may have corrupted the stack so it may
not be safe to continue executing the program.

``` rust
mod exception {
    ..

    #[export_name = "_EXCEPTIONS"]
    pub static EXCEPTIONS: [Option<extern "C" fn()>; 14] = [Some(handler), // NMI
                                                            Some(handler), // Hard fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Memmanage fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Bus fault
                                                            Some(handler), // Usage fault
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            Some(handler), // SVCall
                                                            None, // Reserved for Debug
                                                            None, // Reserved
                                                            Some(handler), // PendSV
                                                            Some(handler)]; // Systick
}
```

On the second part, we create the *global* `_EXCEPTIONS` symbol backed by a
static `EXCEPTIONS` variable. The [documentation] states that there are 14
exception "slots" right after the reset handler so we'll place a 14-element
array of function pointers in the `EXCEPTIONS` variable. Some of the exception
slots, the ones marked as "Reserved" in the docs, will never be used at runtime;
we'll leave those uninitialized (i.e. zeroed). In Rust, function pointers `fn()`
are non-nullable. To get nullable function pointers we must wrap the `fn()`s in
an `Option`, then the `None` variant becomes the equivalent of the null pointer.

## Build and inspect

It's always a good idea to inspect the output binary to check that everything
looks as expected:

```
$ xargo build --target $TARGET

$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -CD target/$TARGET/debug/app

./target/$TARGET/debug/app:     file format elf32-littlearm


Disassembly of section .text:

```

The two most relevant things to note: The `exception::handler` is located at
address `0x0800_0052`. And, `_EXCEPTIONS`, the part of the vector table where
the exception handlers reside, is mainly filled with the thumb address of
`exception::handler` i.e. `0x0800_0053`; which is what we wanted. You will also
see a few `0x0`s inside `_EXCEPTIONS`. These are the reserved exceptions slots
and they are basically zeroed/uninitialized chunks of memory.

## Let's crash!

> **NOTE** This program won't work on QEMU. AFAICT, raising an exception on a
> emulated device is rather hard. For some reason (probably to simplify the

Let's write a program that raises an exception to test the exception handler.
Our program will attempt to read memory beyond the RAM region. Here is it:

``` rust
#[export_name = "_reset"]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    unsafe {
        let sram_boundary = *(0x0000_0000 as *const u32);
        let _crash = *(sram_boundary as *const u32);
    }

    loop {}
}
```

Let' run the program under the debugger on real hardware.

```
# On another terminal
$ [sudo] openocd (..)
```

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb target/cortex-m3/debug/app
(gdb) target remote :3333

(gdb) load

(gdb) step
9               let sram_boundary = *(0x0000_0000 as *const u32)

(gdb) step
10              let _crash = *(ram_boundary as *const u32)

(gdb) print/x ram_boundary
$1 = 0x2000a000

(gdb) step
app::exception::handler () at src/main.rs:19
19                  asm!("bkpt")
```

Remember that the address `0x0000_0000` is the first element of the vector table
and contains the highest RAM address. Dereferencing that address
(`sram_boundary`) will load memory beyond the RAM region.

Upon trying to read invalid memory, the processor raises *an* exception (we
don't know *which* one) and then proceeds to execute the `exception::handler`.
While executing the handler, the processor encounters the `bkpt` instruction,
halts and yields control back to the debugger.

We'll use this very simple exception handler to uncover programming mistakes
while debugging. We'll revisit the exception handler in the future to make it
tell us which exception was raised and which instruction (and line of code)
generated the exception.

## Homework

What do you think would have happened if we executed the last `main` function
that reads memory beyond the RAM boundary **if** we didn't *install* the
exception handlers, or IOW if we didn't add the `_EXCEPTIONS` symbol or the
`EXCEPTIONS` variable to our program?
