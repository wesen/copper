# Audience

> Who is this documentation aimed towards?

This site is aimed at people that:

- Have a basic knowledge of Rust. If you haven't been introduced to Rust yet, you should check out
  the (Rust) ["book"] and [these other great learning resources][0].
  
["book"]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
[0]: https://github.com/ctjhoa/rust-learning

- Have access, own, or are willing to buy an ARM Cortex-M development board.

> **NOTE** You *can* follow this material *without* a dev board by using an emulator. But your
> learning experience (and enjoyment!) will likely suffer as you will only be able to execute a few
> of the programs that we'll develop here due to limitations in emulators (not all the
> microcontroller functionality is implemented).

On the other hand, you **don't** need to know about any of these topics to follow this material: 

- Assembly.
- Electronics.
- Microcontrollers.
- The ARM (Cortex-M) architecture.
- The C programming language.

If you are already familiar with embedded development using C/C++, please tag along! I'm sure you'll
find the information about tooling (Cargo instead of Make) and Rust abstractions (traits as
interfaces) interesting. Plus, I'd love to hear your opinion about how non-Rust concepts (like the
ARM boot process, linker scripts, etc) are explained.
