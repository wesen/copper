# First program

In this chapter we'll write our first program! Although the program is going to be relatively
uninteresting -- it just allocates some variables on the stack. It will help us:

- Verify that the development environment is correctly set up.
- Get familiar with the several tools that make up the development environment.
- Learn about the device-specific pieces required for cross compilation.

We'll first cross compile this program for the [LM3S6965][0] microcontroller and then run it under
QEMU. After we verify that it works correctly, we'll run the program on real hardware.
