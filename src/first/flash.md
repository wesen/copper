It's time to test our program on real hardware! We'll use OpenOCD  to *flash*
our program into the microcontroller and then hook `gdb` and OpenOCD to debug
our program just like we did before.

> Wait, what's flashing?

*Flashing* means we are going to transfer our program from the host machine (PC,
laptop, etc.) to the target device (the microcontroller). Once flashed, the
micro will execute the flashed program every time it boots or resets.

> **ATTENTION!** The flashing instructions here will overwrite the program

## Compile for a different target device

Unless you happen to have a real LM3S6965EVB board right next to you, the binary
we produced in the previous section won't work for your device. To produce a
valid binary for your device, you'll have to change the cross compilation target
from the LM3S6965 to *your* device and then rebuild the program.

For the rest of this section, I'll be using the [STM32F3DISCOVERY] as the target
device.

### Update the linker script

One of the things that you'll always have to do when changing the cross
compilation target is to update the device-specific parts of the linker script.

The STM32F3DISCOVERY contains a [STM32F303VCT6] micro with 256 KiB of flash and
40+8 (\*) KiB of RAM. A peculiarity of STM32 devices is that their flash memory starts
at address `0x0800_0000`.

(\*) RAM is split in two memory regions located at different addresses.

[STM32F303VCT6]: http://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f303vc.pdf

*My* linker script adjustments look like this (yours will probably look
different):

``` diff
 MEMORY
 {
-  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 256K
-  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
+  CCRAM : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 8K
+  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
+  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 40K
 }
```

### Change the target specification

Depending on the micro in your dev board, you may also have to change the
`rustc` target from `thumbv7m-none-eabi` to something else. In my case, the
STM32F303VCT6 contains a Cortex-M4F processor with FPU so I need to switch to the
`thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target.

## Build & inspect

Now that the changes have been committed, we can rebuild the program:

```
$ xargo build --target $TARGET
```

> **NOTE** From now on, I'm going to use `$TARGET`, instead of e.g.
>  `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`, as a placeholder for the cross compilation target to
>  make sure you don't use the wrong target triple.

<!-- FIXME use build.rs to force a rebuild when the linker script has been -->
<!-- modified -->

As usual, it's a good idea to inspect the binary with `objdump` to verify that
the vector table is where expected.

```
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -Cd ./target/$TARGET/debug/app

./target/$TARGET/debug/app:     file format elf32-littlearm


Disassembly of section .text:

08000000 <_reset-0x8>:
 8000000:       2000a000        .word   0x2000a000
 8000004:       08000009        .word   0x08000009

08000008 <_reset>:
 8000008:       b083            sub     sp, #12
 800000a:       e7ff            b.n     800000c <_reset+0x4>
 800000c:       202a            movs    r0, #42 ; 0x2a
 800000e:       9001            str     r0, [sp, #4]
 8000010:       9002            str     r0, [sp, #8]
 8000012:       e7ff            b.n     8000014 <_reset+0xc>
 8000014:       e7fe            b.n     8000014 <_reset+0xc>
```

Looks good! The vector table is at `0x0800_0000` as expected for my device.

## Establishing an OpenOCD connection

Before we flash the program we have to "open" an OpenOCD connection between the
device and the host machine. You should be already familiar with these steps
from the [development environment][de] chapter:

[de]: linux.html#First%20OpenOCD%20connection

```
# Physically connect the dev board to the host machine (probably your laptop), then
$ [sudo] openocd -f board/$BOARD
(...)
Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz
Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz
Info : clock speed 950 kHz
Info : STLINK v2 JTAG v27 API v2 SWIM v15 VID 0x0483 PID 0x374B
Info : using stlink api v2
Info : Target voltage: 2.919073
Info : stm32f3x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints
```

## Flash and debug

We'll use the `gdb` shell to both flash and debug the program. So, fire up
`gdb`:

> **NOTE** You can't use `lldb` this time `:-(`. AFAICT, there's no `lldb`
> equivalent to the `monitor` and `load` commands provided by `gdb`. And those
> commands are required in this section.

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb target/$TARGET/debug/app
```

Next, we need to connect `gdb` and OpenOCD. The command is the same as the one
we used with QEMU:

```
(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
```

You should also see extra output on the OpenOCD terminal but maybe not the exact
same output shown here:

``` diff
 Info : stm32f1x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints
+Info : accepting 'gdb' connection on tcp/3333
+Info : device id = 0x10036422
+Info : flash size = 256kbytes
```

Now that we are connected to the device via `gdb`. Let's flash the program using
the `load` command:

```
(gdb) load
Loading section .text, size 0x16 lma 0x8000000
Start address 0x8000008, load size 20
Transfer rate: 246 bytes/sec, 10 bytes/write.
```

You should also see new output on the OpenOCD terminal:

``` diff
 Info : accepting 'gdb' connection on tcp/3333
 Info : device id = 0x10036422
 Info : flash size = 256kbytes
+Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz
+Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz
+adapter speed: 950 kHz

+Info : Unable to match requested speed 1000 kHz, using 950 kHz

+target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread
+xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x08000194 msp: 0x2000a000
```

The program is now flashed and the device is halted at the program's entry
point, i.e. the `main` function. Let's repeat the debug session we used for the
previous QEMU run:

```
(gdb) step
8           let x = 42

(gdb) step
9           y = x

(gdb) print x
$1 = 42

(gdb) print &x
$2 = (i32 *) 0x20001ffc

(gdb) print y
$3 = -2052926870

(gdb) print/x y
$4 = 0x85a2d26a

(gdb) print &y
$5 = (i32 *) 0x20001ff8

(gdb) step
11          loop {}

(gdb) print y
$5 = 42
```

Yay! This time the uninitialized value of `y` looks more random; I got
`-2052926870` on this run.

While you executed the above commands, you should have seen more output on the
OpenOCD terminal. Each time you stepped over the program, OpenOCD printed the
*program counter* which is the address of the instruction the processor will
execute next.

``` diff
 xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x08000008 msp: 0x20002000
+Info : halted: PC: 0x0800000a
+Info : halted: PC: 0x0800000c
+Info : halted: PC: 0x0800000e
+Info : halted: PC: 0x08000010
```

Here's one more trick for you to try:

```
(gdb) monitor reset halt
```

This will generate the following OpenOCD output:

```
 Info : halted: PC: 0x08000010
+target state: halted
+target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread
+xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x08000008 msp: 0x20002000
```

This will reset your microcontroller (!) and halt your program at the reset
handler, i.e. the `main` function.

For fun, let's inspect the `y` variable **before** it's initialized:

```
(gdb) step
8           let x = 42

(gdb) step
9           y = x

(gdb) print x
$6 = 42

(gdb) print &x
$7 = (i32 *) 0x20001ffc

(gdb) print y
$8 = 42

(gdb) print &y
$9 = (i32 *) 0x20001ff8
```

Surprise! `y` appears to have been already initialized! Except, that's not the
case. What actually happened is that resetting the microcontroller doesn't touch
RAM (i.e. it doesn't power it off). Therefore, the RAM still holds the data from
the previous run and that's why `y` hold the value `42` it was assigned during
the *previous* run of the program.

That's all for this section! You can now close both OpenOCD and `gdb`. Let's
move onto more complex programs!
