# Build & inspect

Let's start by creating a new Cargo project:

```
$ cargo new --bin app && cd $_
```

And then add these files to the project:

- [layout.ld](./first/layout.ld) - a "linker script"
- [.cargo/config](./first/config) - a project local Cargo configuration file
- [src/main.rs](./first/main.rs)

I'll explain what the linker script and the Cargo configuration file are for in
a later section. It's not important to know what it does *right now*.

Your project directory should look like this:

```
$ tree .
.
├── .cargo
│   └── config
├── Cargo.toml
├── layout.ld
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

For convenience, `src/main.rs` is replicated here:

``` rust
#![feature(lang_items)]

// We won't use the usual `main` function. We are going to use a different
// "entry point".
#![no_main]

// We won't use the standard library because it requires OS abstractions like
// threads and files and those are not available on this platform.
#![no_std]

// Conceptually, this is our program "entry point". It's the first thing the
// microcontroller will execute when it (re)boots. This entry point must be a
// `pub`lic function named `_reset` to be recognized as such because that's what
// our linker script (`layout.ld`) states. Later, we'll say more about these
// requirements.
//
// Also, returning from this function is undefined because there is nothing to
// return to! To statically forbid returning from this function, we mark it as
// "divergent", hence the `fn() -> !` signature.
#[export_name = "_reset"]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    // Our first program initializes some variables on the stack and does
    // nothing more. Yay!
    let y;
    let x = 42;
    y = x;

    // We can't return from this function so we just spin endlessly here.
    loop {}
}

// Finally, we need to define the panic_fmt "lang item", which is just a
// function. This specifies what the program should do when a `panic!` occurs.
// Our program won't panic, so we can leave the function body empty for now.
mod lang_items {
    #[lang = "panic_fmt"]
    extern "C" fn panic_fmt() {}
}
```

If you have written a native Rust program before, this shouldn't look that
different except that `main` has a different signature.

Now you can build the Cargo project:

```
$ xargo build --target thumbv7m-none-eabi
   Compiling core v0.0.0 (file://$sysroot/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src/libcore)
   Compiling alloc v0.0.0 (file://$sysroot/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src/liballoc)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 19.56 secs
   Compiling rustc_unicode v0.0.0 (file://$sysroot/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src/librustc_unicode)

    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.78 secs
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0 secs
   Compiling app v0.1.0 (file://$PWD)
```

## Trust, but verify

The project appeared to build fine, but it's always a good idea to inspect the
executable. We are going to look at three things:

### Memory layout

First, you have to appreciate the fact that, during its execution, everything in
a program resides in (physical) memory and has an associated memory address.
Now, everything that's *statically allocated*, like functions and static
variables, gets assigned an address at compile time. Whereas, everything else,
like local/stack variables and "heap" allocated variables, gets assigned an
address at runtime.

We can observe the addresses of statically allocated stuff using `objdump`.
Let's check our executable:

```
# with
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump --demangle --disassemble target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app

# or its shorter form
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -Cd target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app

target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app:     file format elf32-littlearm


Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <_reset-0x8>:
   0:   20010000        .word   0x20010000
   4:   00000009        .word   0x00000009

00000008 <_reset>:
   8:   b083            sub     sp, #12
   a:   e7ff            b.n     c <_reset+0x4>
   c:   202a            movs    r0, #42 ; 0x2a
   e:   9002            str     r0, [sp, #8]
  10:   9001            str     r0, [sp, #4]
  12:   e7ff            b.n     14 <_reset+0xc>
  14:   e7fe            b.n     14 <_reset+0xc>
```

Let me highlight the important bits of the output:

```
00000000
   0:	20010000

00000004
   4:	00000009

00000008 <_reset>:
   8:                   sub     sp, #12
   a:                   b.n     c <_reset+0x4>
   c:                   movs    r0, #42 ; 0x2a
   e:                   str     r0, [sp, #8]
  10:                   str     r0, [sp, #4]
  12:                   b.n     14 <_reset+0xc>
  14:                   b.n     14 <_reset+0xc>
```

Now let's read the output section by section:

```
00000000
   0:	20010000
```

"The memory at address `0x0` holds the (`u32`) value `0x2001_0000`". When the
program starts its execution, that part of the memory will be already
initialized to that value.

```
00000004
   4:	00000009
```

Likewise, "the memory at `0x4` holds the  (`u32`) value `0x9`".

```
00000008 <start>:
   8:	          	sub	sp, #8
   a:	          	movs	r0, #42	; 0x2a
   c:	          	str	r0, [sp, #4]
   e:	          	str	r0, [sp, #0]
  10:	          	b.n	12 <start+0xa>
  12:	          	b.n	12 <start+0xa>
```

Finally, "the `start` function resides at address `0x8`". The lines, like
`sub sp, #8`, below `<start>` are the instructions that make up the function.
When the processor executes this function, it will execute each one of these
instructions.

But, why are these addresses/values important? During boot, the microcontroller
reads the memory section at `0x0..0x8` and uses those  values to complete the
boot process. In other words, the values in that memory section have an special
meaning to the boot process. In a [later section], we'll explain what those
values mean and how they are used in the boot process. For now, it's okay to
just confirm that the memory at `0x0..0x8` is initialized.

[later section]: details/boot.html

### Program size

Microcontrollers are memory constrained devices. It's important to keep an eye
on the size of our programs to make sure they don't exceed the memory capacity
of our device. We'll use the `size` command to do that:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-size target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     22       0       0      22      16 target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
```

The output mentions three different memory *sections*:

- The `text` section contains the "program code", i.e. all the instructions that
  the processor will execute when the program is executed. Functions go in this
  section. This section also stores   constants like strings. `static CONSTANT:
  &'static str = "Hello, world!"`is an example of a constant.
- `data` holds static variables that have an initial value, for example `static
  mut X: i32 = 42`.
- On the contrary, `bss` holds "uninitialized" static variables. Because of C
  heritage, here "uninitialized" actually means *zeroed*. For example, `static
  mut ZEROS: [u8; 4] = [0; 4]` would go in this section.

`dec` is just the sum of these three sections and `hex` is the hexadecimal
representation of `dec`.

Our program size is just 22 bytes big! Microcontrollers usually have memory
capacities in the order of a few KiB up to hundreds of KiB. In particular, the
LM3S6965 microcontroller, which we are going to emulate, has 256KiB of (Flash)
memory. So, no problem here; this program will fit in the device memory.

> **NOTE** KiB = [Kibibyte] = 1024 bytes

### Entry point

To work properly, tools like `gdb` and `qemu` need to be informed about the
program entry point, which is where the program starts its execution.

We can check our program entry point using the `readelf` command:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-readelf -h target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           ARM
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x9 <--
  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          67236 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x5000200, Version5 EABI, soft-float ABI
  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         2
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         15
  Section header string table index: 12
```

There you can see that `0x9` is the entry point address. From the previous
`objdump` output, you know that `0x8` is the address of the `main` function
which we want to be the entry point. At first, this looks wrong because the
address is off by 1, but this is actually correct.

Cortex M microcontrollers always operate in "thumb" mode (i.e. they use "thumb"
instructions). To indicate this thumb state all function address have their
first bit (position 0) set to 1. Because `0x8 | 0b1` is `0x9`, `0x9` is the
address of `main` when called in thumb mode.

This means that `main` have been correctly declared as the entry point.
