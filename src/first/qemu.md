# Run the program under QEMU

Now that we have an executable in our hands, it's time to test it under an
emulator! You may be wondering "how are we going to do that?" since the program
doesn't do any I/O. Well, instead of expecting the program to output something
to the terminal (which won't happen), we are going to "hook" a debugger to the
emulator, execute the program "statement by statement" and verify that the
emulated memory changes as the program executes. Sounds fun? You bet it is.

Let's start! The first thing we have to do is load our binary in the emulator
with this command:

```
$ qemu-system-arm \
    -cpu cortex-m3 \
    -machine lm3s6965evb \
    -gdb tcp::3333 \
    -S \
    -nographic -monitor null \
    -serial null \
    -kernel target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
```

So many arguments! Let's explain why all those are there for:

- `qemu-system-arm` this is a QEMU variant that can emulate an ARM processor in
  system mode emulation.

- `-machine lm3s6965evb` this is the dev board we are going to emulate: the
  [LM3S6965EVB].

- `-cpu cortex-m3` this is the CPU to emulate, it must match the CPU of the
  emulated `machine`.

- `-gdb tcp::3333` tells the emulator to expect a gdb connection on port `3333`,
  we need this to control the execution of the emulated program under gdb.

- `-S` "do not immediately start the CPU". This tells the emulator to load the
  program but don't immediately execute it, otherwise by the time you attach
  `gdb` your program may have already terminated!

- `-nographic`, `-monitor null` we don't need anything graphic related

- `-serial null` we are not going to use the serial console this time

- `-kernel target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app` use our binary directly as the
  "kernel" which is the first thing the emulator executes.

This command will block; just leave it running for now.

Next we hook a debugger to the emulator we just started. In another terminal,
type:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb -q target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
```

> **NOTE** You can use `lldb` instead of `gdb` but you won't be able to use the
> same commands I have used here, because `lldb` uses different commands to
> expose the same functionality as `gdb`. [This page] will help you map `gdb`
> commands to `lldb`'s and vice versa.

Under this `gdb` session, enter the following command to connect to the
emulator:

```
(gdb) target remote :3333
```

You should see an output like this:

```
Remote debugging using :3333
app::main () at $PWD/src/main.rs:6
6       pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
```

The emulator is *halted* and currently at the program entry point: `main`. You
can now execute the program statement by statement using the `step` command:

```
(gdb) step
8           let x = 42
(gdb) step
9           y = x
```

At this point the statement `let x = 42` has been executed but the statement
`y = x` has not, so `x` is initialized but `y` is not. Let's inspect both
variables by `print`ing their addresses and values.

```
(gdb) print x
$1 = 42
(gdb) print &x
$2 = (i32 *) 0x2000fff8
(gdb) print y
$3 = 0
(gdb) print &y
$4 = (i32 *) 0x2000fffc
```

A few things to note:

- Both `x` and `y` live in the "stack". That's why they have contiguous
  addresses.

- `y`, which was declared before `x`, has a larger address than `x`. The reason
  is that the stack grows downwards (toward smaller addresses). If you keep
  creating stack variables, you'll see their addresses get smaller and smaller.

- `y` which is currently uninitialized holds the value `0` -- this is a QEMU
  simplification. On real hardware you will observe that uninitialized variables
  hold random values. Of course, (safe) Rust won't actually let you *use*
  uninitialized variables but you can peek at them using `gdb`.

Back to the debugger. If you step again, you should see that `y` is now
initialized:

```
(gdb) step
11          loop {}
(gdb) print y
$5 = 42
```

The emulator is about to execute an endless loop. If you call `step` again,
`gdb` will get stuck in the loop and hang. Instead, call `stepi` to advance *one
instruction* rather than one statement.

```
(gdb) stepi
0x00000014      10          loop {}
(gdb) stepi
0x00000014      10          loop {}
```

Congrats, you are now stuck in an endless loop!

There is not much left to do in this emulation. But, before you terminate the
`gdb` session and exit the emulator ...

## Homework

`gdb` has an ["examine"] command that let's you inspect the contents of memory
at a certain address. Try the following command:

["examine"]: http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_56.html

```
(gdb) x/4x main
```

Compare the output of that command with the output of the command:
`arm-none-eabi-objdump -Cd target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app`. Are the outputs
related somehow? Elaborate.
