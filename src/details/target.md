# Target specification

In this section, we explain why we compiled our crate with `--target
thumbv7m-none-eabi`.

Building a Rust program for a Cortex-M microcontroller involves cross compiling.
Cross compilation is the process of building a binary that will run on a
**target** device/system that's different from the **host** device/system where
the binary was produced. In our case, the target is the Cortex-M microcontroller
and the host is your laptop or your PC.

Out of the box, `rustc`, and therefore Cargo, can cross compile for a bunch of
different targets using the `--target` flag.

Here's the list of supported cross compilation targets as of November of 2016
(this list will continue growing over time):

Luckily for us, since nightly-2016-10-05, `rustc` supports Cortex-M
microcontrollers as cross compilation targets. Furthermore, there is not 1 but
actually 4 different targets. Which one to pick depends on which microcontroller
you are targeting:

- `thumbv6m-none-eabi`. For Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+ and Cortex-M1 micros.

- `thumbv7m-none-eabi`. For the Cortex-M3 micro.

- `thumbv7em-none-eabi`. For the Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 micros that *don't*
  have a FPU.

- `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`. For the Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 micros that *have* a
  FPU.

In the case of the LM3S6965, we want to use the `thumbv7m-none-eabi` target
because that microcontroller has a Cortex-M3 processor in it.
