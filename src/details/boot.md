# Boot process

In this section, we'll learn what the microcontroller does right after it's powered.

## Memory

But before that, we have to talk a little about the different types of memory available in a
microcontroller. Cortex-M microcontrollers have at least two different types of memory available to
them: Flash memory and Random Access Memory (RAM).

Flash memory is non-volatile and it's used to store the `text` section of our program, i.e.
functions and constants. Because this memory is non-volatile, our program will persist in memory
even if the microcontroller is powered off.

RAM, on the other hand, is volatile and it's used to store the [call stack], the [heap] and static
variables. Because RAM is volatile, its contents are lost when the microcontroller is powered off.
Also, when the microcontroller have just been powered on, its RAM is filled with random values.

[heap]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#HEAP

These two different memories can be accessed by the processor through the same address space. For
instance, the LM3S6965 has the following memory specifications:

- 256 KiB of flash memory. The flash memory region starts at address `0x0` and ends at address
  `0x40000`.
- 64 KiB of RAM. The RAM region starts at address `0x2000_0000` and ends at address `0x2001_0000`.

### Vector table

On Cortex-M microcontrollers, the beginning of the flash memory holds a data structure known as the
"vector table". The values stored in the vector table are used in different hardware processes like
the boot process.

The vector table is, effectively, an array of pointers and each of its elements is used for a
different purpose. The vector table is fully documented [here]. But, right now, we are only
interested in its first two elements:

1. At `0x0`: the initial value of the stack pointer.

The stack pointer is a register used to track the top of the call stack. The initial value
determines where in memory the call stack will be initialized. As per the [AAPCS][AAPCS] (ARM
Architecture Procedure Call Standard), the call stack grows downwards (towards smaller addresses).
That's why the initial value of the stack pointer is usually set to the largest valid address of the
RAM region.

2. At `0x4`: the reset vector

A "vector" is a pointer to a "handler" and a "handler" is just another name for a function.
Therefore, the reset vector is a (function) pointer to the reset handler. The reset handler gets
called, through the reset vector, whenever a reset occurs and during the boot process.

## Putting everything together

Here's what happens during the boot process or whenever the microcontroller is reset:

- `SP = *(0x0 as *const usize)`. The stack pointer, which is a register, is initialized to the value
  stored at address `0x0`.
- `(*(0x4 as *const fn()))()`. The reset handler gets called through the reset vector.

## The takeaway

What you should remember from all this is that the programs you write for Cortex-M microcontrollers
must comply with a **specific memory layout**. In particular, the memory section at address `0x0`,
the vector table, must be properly initialized or your microcontroller won't boot! In the next
section, we'll go over the boot process again using the LM3S6965 as an example.
