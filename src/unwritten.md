# Unwritten topics

- More debugging patterns: breakpoints, watchpoints, `bkpt`, etc.
- The `.data` and `.bss` sections: `static` variables, linker script (again) and initialization
  routine.
- Guaranteed `panic!`-free programs with this one weird trick!
- The Rust allocator interface.
- Debug prints with ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell)
- "Apps"
  - Heartbeat LED
  - Read an analog sensor. e.g. just potentiometer, a photoresistor or a CNY70.
  - Read a digital sensor via SPI or I2C. e.g. motion sensor.
  - Data acquisition. e.g. sensor + serial comm
  - Move a servomotor
  - Open loop control system. e.g. serial comm + servo or potentiometer + servo
  - Closed loop control system. e.g. servo + magnetometer
- Interfacing external devices
  - Buttons and debouncing.
  - Servomotors.
- Async and concurrency
  - Scheduling strategies: Super loop, cooperative, preemptive.
  - Interrupts: `asm!("cpsid i")`, `asm!("cpsie i")`, data races and atomic operations.
  - DMA
- FPU
- `nm -C --size-sort`: binary size profiling
- `nm -C`: global vs local text symbol
- librarify: src/lib.rs + src/bin/*.rs. Uses `extern` (lib) and `no_mangle` (bin) symbol. Basically
  the library says: you (the binary) must give me a symbol with this *unmangled* name. Downside:
  types signatures are lost. How to recover them? traits? Related: weak symbols for e.g. exceptions.
- ARM calling convention:
  - cf. http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042f/IHI0042F_aapcs.pdf
  - A diagram of how the stack, the heap and static variables (.data, .bss) are allocated in RAM.
  - An explanation of how the call stack works: stack pointer, stack frames, what happens when a
    function/interrupt is called, etc.
  - How arguments are passed to functions: via stack, registers
- mention that a section can't exceed its region capacity. This is automatically enforced by the
  linker based on what the linker script says.
- bluetooth: HC-06. `rfcomm bind rfcomm0 $ADDRESS`
- document other flashing methods: ELF -> `objcopy` -> binary, then directly flash the binary using
  OpenOCD (without `gdb`) or st-link.
- revisit the default exception handler: where did we come from? (inspect stack) which exception is
  this? (inspect NVIC(?) register).

- embedding Rust in C frameworks like FreeRTOS or the Photon.
