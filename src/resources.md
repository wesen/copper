## Cortex-M

The ultimate source of information about this processor family is the [ARM info center][0].

[0]: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.set.cortexm/index.html

Some documents of interest:

- [Cortex-M0 Devices - Generic User Guide][0]. About the Cortex-M0 processor, its instruction set
  and its peripherals.
- [Cortex-M0+ Devices - Generic User Guide][1]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M0+.
- [Cortex-M3 Devices - Generic User Guide][2]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M3.
- [Cortex-M4 Devices - Generic User Guide][3]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M4.
- [Cortex-M7 Devices - Generic User Guide][4]. Same as above but for the Cortex-M7.
- [Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture][5]. About the machine registers, how
  subroutines are called, how their parameters are passed and how their results are returned.
- [Lazy Stacking and Context Switching][6]. How the processor automatically decides when (not) to
  save floating-point registers on the stack during interrupts. Important if implementing an OS, as
  one should re-implement this functionality in their context switching logic to keep context
  switching times small.

## LM3S6965EVB

This is the evaluation board we'll emulate using QEMU. It contains an LM3S6965 microcontroller. The
most important bits of documentation related to this board are:

- The [Microcontroller data sheet][6]. It contains the register maps and the descriptions of all the
  device peripherals.
- The [Evaluation Board User manual][7]. Description of the physical board.

The Zinc project was the pioneer in the embedded Rust space. I have borrowed a lot of ideas from
there (like building executables using only Cargo) to write this book.
